## How it works ðŸ’¡

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [OpenTok](https://tokbox.com/)
- [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api)

### React ðŸ”¥
For the front end part, we used ReactJS which is a Javascript library that allows us to write JSX code into out applications, allowing us to control the rendering of components individually.
```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

const Home = props => {
  const [rooms, setRooms] = useState("");
  const [users, setUsers] = useState({});
```
### Bootstrap and SASSðŸ“š
Combined with CSS libraries like bootstrap we could give Talk4Free a very light and cool look. Bootstrap allows us to have control over the positioning of elements into the DOM, also combined with SASS we can have a so much organized code structure so it can be understood and maintained easily
```javascript
import { Container, Button } from "react-bootstrap";
```
```css
.chatRooms {
  padding: 3rem 0px 2rem 0px;

  text-align: center;
  .lead {
    margin: 30px 10px;
    a {
      font-weight: 500;
    }
  }
  button {
    margin: auto;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    svg {
      margin-left: 5px;
    }
  }
}
```

### OpenTok (Where the magic happens!) ðŸŽ©

For the RTC (Real-Time Communication) part, we implemented a very useful tool called OpenTok. OpenTok allows us to make the connections peer to peer through their server so they can communicate in real-time. Opentok gave us an API_SECRET_KEY which we can use to create sessions (Rooms) and tokens for each user interested in joining that session. Every token is unique and can be only used for the room it was created for. Here a graphic example:

<p align="center"><img src="https://tokbox.com/developer/img/infographics/opentok-components@2x.png" width="480" height="360" alt="videocalls" align="middle"></p>

```javascript
const CreateSessionId = async () => {
  const token = getJWT();
  const settings = {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Accept: "application/json",
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
      "X-OPENTOK-AUTH": token
    },
    body: {
      archiveMode: "always",
      "p2p.preference": "disabled"
    }
  };
  let sessionId = "";
  try {
    await fetch(`https://api.opentok.com/session/create`, settings)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(res => (sessionId = res[0].session_id));
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
  return sessionId;
};
```

### Google API ðŸ”‘

For logging in we used the API from google which is very easy to use. You send them the email, and google handles authentication for us, returning an object with all the information we need (name, email, profile picture etc):

```javascript
<GoogleLogin
  clientId={process.env.REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}
  render={renderProps => (
    <React.Fragment>
      <Button
        variant="primary"
        // className="ml-5"
        id="signInBtn"
        onClick={renderProps.onClick}
        disabled={renderProps.disabled}
      >
        {this.state.isSignedIn ? this.state.userName : "Sign In"}
        <FaSignInAlt />
      </Button>
    </React.Fragment>
  )}
  buttonText="Login"
  onSuccess={this.responseGoogle}
  onFailure={this.responseGoogle}
  isSignedIn={true}
  cookiePolicy={"single_host_origin"}
/>
```
